# How to contribute

We welcome third-party contributions to Nails, in fact we expect it! We set
out to build a tool for ourselves, and hope that we can make other's lives
easier, too.

## Making Changes

We're big fans of the `git flow` model, and use it for this project. We're
flexible with regards acceppting push requests, but please adhere to the
following guidelines:

1. Use a git flow feature branch for your patch
2. Use PSR-2 coding style
3. Remove all trailing whitespace
4. Update, and compile, the documentation if necessary
